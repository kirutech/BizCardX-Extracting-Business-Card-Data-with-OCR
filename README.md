## EasyOCR: Effortless Optical Character Recognition for Python Developers
EasyOCR, as the name implies, is a Python package specifically designed for computer vision developers to seamlessly perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks. It enables effortless text extraction from images and scanned documents. In my project, I employed EasyOCR to extract text from business cards.
### EasyOCR: A Straightforward Approach to OCR
EasyOCR stands out as the most straightforward approach to OCR, offering several advantages:
•	Easy Installation: The EasyOCR package can be installed with a single pip command.
•	Minimal Dependencies: EasyOCR's minimal dependencies make it easy to set up your OCR development environment.
•	Simple Integration: Once installed, EasyOCR can be integrated into your project with a single import statement.
•	Streamlined OCR Process: OCR can be performed with just two lines of code: one to initialize the Reader class and another to apply OCR using the readtext function.
## BizCardX: A User-Friendly Tool for Business Card Data Extraction
BizCardX is a user-friendly tool that leverages OCR technology to extract information from business cards. The extracted data is classified using regular expressions and stored in a SQL database. A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Streamlit provides seamless user interaction.
### BizCardX: A Simple and Intuitive Interface
The BizCardX application features a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the entire process, from uploading business card images to extracting information. The extracted information is presented in a clean and organized manner, allowing users to add it to the database with a single click. The data stored in the database can be easily read, updated, and deleted as per user requirements.
